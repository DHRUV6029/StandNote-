## Turning Conversations into Actions

Web conferencing and online meetings have become the new work culture nowadays. But somewhere along the lines, we often keep missing the crux of the discussions in these online meetings, and here comes our solution - **StandNote**. It is your easy to use online meeting assistant that backs you up with automated meeting minutes in every conversation. It will help you save time on board meetings, team management, and customer support such that you just focus on the conversation and never miss whatâ€™s important.

It could be used along with all video conferencing tools - Google meet, Zoom, Blue Jeans, GoToMeeting, Microsoft Teams, and more. Whatâ€™s more special is - using our unique machine learning algorithms, it will extract essential Action Items, Decisions, and crucial Insights, and transcript and turn them into a comprehensive, collaborative meeting summary. It will be packed with a bunch of important integrations like - Slack, GitHub, Keep, Notion to further ease your work life.
